Installation
******************************************

System Optimiser does not use an installer, but is rather shipped as a portable executable.
This does, however, not mean that you can simply copy System Optimiser to another system and run it, as you still need to download the :ref:`dataset <DVM>`.

Please follow the :ref:`Installation Instructions<installSO>` after :ref:`downloading the latest build<website>`.
