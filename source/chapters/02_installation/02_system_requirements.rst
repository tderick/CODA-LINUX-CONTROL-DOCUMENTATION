System Requirements
===================

**Minimum Requirements**

The absolute minimum requirements to run CODA System Optimiser are:

    * 4-Core x64 CPU with SSE4.2 Support or Apple Silicon (Apple M1)
    * 4GB RAM
    * 1920 x 1080 Display
    * OpenGL v3.3
    * MacOS 10.14+ / Windows 10 1903+ / Linux Kernel Version 4.15+ and glibc >= 2.31 (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04)

**Recommended Specification**

    * At least 16 cores (System Optimiser has been tested with up to 128 cores)
    * CPUs with large caches (this helps to keep our high precision balloon files close to the core)
    * x64 architecture (currently ARM-based architectures do not provide satisfactory performance)
