Introduction to LINUS Control

System Optimiser allows you to accurately simulate CODA Audio Loudspeakers in any :ref:`3D View<3dview>` with unmatched precision and speed.
Design all sizes of audio system from the smallest of gatherings right up to the largest of stadium productions with incredible ease.
:ref:`SPL Pressure mapping<SPLRendering>` is presented to you in incredible detail, with a strong sense of reality.
Workflow is tantamount to accuracy and with this in mind, bespoke tools are provided to fully enable the system designer.

Computationally intensive operations have been highly optimised to deliver results in seconds, not minutes.
Predictions are wholly based on real-world electro-acoustic measurements, heavily utilising :ref:`sophisticated interpolation techniques for loudspeaker directivity<balloons>`.
A highly complex atmospheric model is employed; taking temperature, dewpoint, humidity and altitude into account.
Complex response functions are morphed using cutting edge continuous phase techniques, the end result being authentic free-field predictions indistinguishable from reality.

| Clever tools are included to create complex designs effortlessly:
|  Use the :ref:`arrangement tool<arrangement>` to place loudspeakers in a multitude of shapes and layouts.
|  The :ref:`template engine<templates>` is an incredibly powerful way of managing entities within the arrangement system.
|  :ref:`Measurement Microphones<mics>` can be placed anywhere within the :ref:`3D View<3dview>`.
|  :ref:`Probes<probes>` are a smart extension of the measurement microphones that make choosing line array angles stress-free.
|  :ref:`Link Groups<linkgroups>` define how line arrays are connected, and allow electronic filters to be applied to correct for distance and splay angle.

The :ref:`Background to the Application<background>` section contains information about the theoretical foundation and background of System Optimiser as well as a general primer of acoustics.
